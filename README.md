## Description

The M-QAP-API, based on the M-QAP (user input) APIs, is developed in CLARISA and integrated into other platforms such as MEL and MARLO. The script will return information from WoS, SCOPUS, Altmetrics, and F.A.I.R metric from GARDIAN at once and will not require any user input nor the addition of partnering institutions into CLARISA.
